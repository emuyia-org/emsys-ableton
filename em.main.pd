#X text 829 363 todo: a way to not abandon a tin that's been set just because the current segment can't alow it - remember that the user wants it until available. plus \, some kind of way to indicate whether a tin will go through on the current segment;
#X text 829 461 bug: triggering transport play messages skips through the seg's reps;

#X text 829 547 todo: a way to fast forward or rewind segments (probably best to trigger a tin with it too so that sync issues are mitigated). this is probably best achieved by utilising a UI indicator that shows the current segment's ID \, and allows you to change that number manually;
