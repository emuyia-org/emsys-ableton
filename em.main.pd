#X text 734 223 concern: make sure megaCMD is picked up automatically on rpi when patch loads \, and that pgmout / midiout channels are set accordingly, f 59;
#X text 734 283 concern: make sure that pi can run this patch properly - especially when it comes to running with pdnext (and any inconsistencies that may bring with my work in plug data);
#X text 734 343 todo: add internal clock just for the sake of testing without the synths. seq24 isn't good for testing because you have to set it up every time \, and it has differing transport behaviour.;
#X text 734 403 concern: tins seem to still go through on mcl loads sometimes \, or just miss sending the stop signal... either way \, sometimes i hear 'doubled up' kicks in the patterns indicating the stop signal is not going through. not sure why this is happening.;
