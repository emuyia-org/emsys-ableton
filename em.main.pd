#X text 802 324 todo: add internal clock just for the sake of testing without the synths. seq24 isn't good for testing because you have to set it up every time \, and it has differing transport behaviour.;
#X text 802 273 todo: some kind of way to indicate whether a tin will go through on the current segment;
#X text 802 454 concern: make sure that the hold function is behaving as expected against the scheduling of segs \, reps and tins;
#X text 802 207 potential bug: make sure that at the start of playing a freshly loaded set \, the first segment isn't playing an extra rep that it shouldn't (one extra before lapsing the first rep);
#X text 796 497 possible bug: seg length is not updated at the start of a freshly loaded set? (look at the bar on transport showing the steps - it runs over?);
