#X text 815 259 todo: a way to fast forward or rewind segments (probably best to trigger a tin with it too so that sync issues are mitigated). this is probably best achieved by utilising a UI indicator that shows the current segment's ID \, and allows you to change that number manually;
#X text 815 345 todo: add internal clock just for the sake of testing without the synths. seq24 isn't good for testing because you have to set it up every time \, and it has differing transport behaviour.;
#X text 815 204 todo: some kind of way to indicate whether a tin will go through on the current segment;
