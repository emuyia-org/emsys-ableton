#X text 734 223 concern: make sure megaCMD is picked up automatically on rpi when patch loads \, and that pgmout / midiout channels are set accordingly, f 59;
#X text 734 283 concern: make sure that pi can run this patch properly - especially when it comes to running with pdnext (and any inconsistencies that may bring with my work in plug data);
#X text 734 343 concern: tins seem to still go through on mcl loads sometimes \, or just miss sending the stop signal... either way \, sometimes i hear 'doubled up' kicks in the patterns indicating the stop signal is not going through. not sure why this is happening.;
