#X text 189 209 PGM change \; - A stop message followed by a PGM \, then start \, could act as an interrupt \, allowing for changing patterns mid sequence like you can with MCL/MD. However this could introduce a lag between? \; - This could also take the form of a 'translation layer' for MCL to send PGM change messages that interrupt the MnM \; - It could also take the form of a sync function that pulls MnM back into sync during any given moment;
#X text 189 354 Parameter adjustment via CC \; - All parameters are available \; - NRPN - Finer control?;
#X text 189 414 Rapid tempo fluctuations \; - Providing MnM sync is possible \, this may take the form of fluctuating only the MnM \; - To do MD this would need to happen through MCL somehow \; - Keeping MCL from adjusting the MnM tempo to match its clock would require turning off external transport in MnM global settings via sysex beforehand;

#X text 760 309 - PD could add notes randomly to any given track \, or take over sequencing entirely \; - Param locks from PD may be possible if the MIDI spec is fast enough \; - Need a way to make sequencing more erratic and chaotic like the other well ventured electronic music programmers;
