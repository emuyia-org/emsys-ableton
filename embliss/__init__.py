# This file makes 'embliss' a Python package.

# You can optionally import key classes/functions here to make them 
# available directly from the package, e.g.:
# from .main import main_loop_function (if you refactor main.py)
# from .midi_handler import MidiHandler
# from .set_manager import SetManager
# from .screen_manager import ScreenManager

# For now, keeping it simple.
