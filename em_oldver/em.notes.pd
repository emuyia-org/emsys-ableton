#X text 363 169 Tempo desync concept: \; for deliberate tempo desync on monomachine against machinedrum \, this could be achieved by setting a global setting to use an internal clock via sysex \, sending sysex tempo messages \, and then resetting to external clock \, with a transport interrupt if necessary to resync;
#X text 803 13 Perf/CC drift concept: \; Certain key params slowly morph around unpredictably. These params can be set by building perf mappings on MCL \, and controlling one or more (or all \, even) of the perf controls (ABCD).;
#X text 803 93 Complex generative MnM melodies & chords: \; Possible through an implementation of KaiGen and other Max devices such as the generative chord device I once used \, and by sending the Poly mode sysex message to automatically use poly mode for certain segments;
#X text 363 13 Song mode \; Or 'set mode' - automatically send PGM to MCL and MnM from text file in Pd;
#X text 363 80 Transport interrupts \; Send timed stop and start messages to MnM and/or MCL to resync after MnM patterns with mismatching scale lengths \, tempo manipulations \, or unintended MIDI clock desyncs;
#X text 803 239 Conditional trigs for MnM \; Send MIDI notes from Pd with random chance to give randomness to MnM in the same way MCL gives to MD.;
#X text 803 189 Passing thought: Would be cool to also try using MCL route to route MD sounds to MnM FX (big clang snares etc. ??);
#X text 33 13 PROPOSED FEATURES: \; - Song mode \; - Transport interrupts \; - Tempo desync (lp) \; - Tempo manipulation (lp) \; - "Perf drift" \; - Complex generative melodies & chords for MnM \; - Conditional trigs for MnM \; - Pd sampler;
#X text 363 266 Tempo manipulation concepts: \; Tempo changes could be sequenced from Pd and stored along with segment information to have deliberate 'slow downs' or 'speed ups' mid-sequence. May be necessary to follow with transport interrupts;
#X text 803 302 Pd sampler features: \; - Load from Pi's disk \; - Inspired by UW machines but with expanded capability \; - Melodic mode as well as chopped up mode - many parameters & axes for control \; - Sequence and control stored as segment data;
